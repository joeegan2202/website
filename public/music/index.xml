We will begin this week with another Christoph Tietze English Introit. This Sunday is commonly known as Laetare Sunday, where pink vestments can be substituted for purple and music that goes beyond supporting singing is allowed. The name Laetare Sunday comes from the first word of the Introit, and we will honor that by singing an English translation encouraging the Church to rejoice in her Messiah. Our offertory hymn will be Attende Domine, a classic of Lent that has a &amp;ldquo;major&amp;rdquo; tonality, because of course, &amp;ldquo;major&amp;rdquo; = &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo;!</description></item><item><title>Third Week of Lent</title><link>https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jee210001/music/lenta-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jee210001/music/lenta-3/</guid><description>Aid Score
Happy spring break everybody! I fully expect to lead these hymns myself this week. You may notice I copied the tune SWABIA from last week&amp;rsquo;s transfiguration hymn and used it along with Christoph Tietze&amp;rsquo;s English Introit translation. I am hoping this makes it easy for people to follow since they will have heard the tune last week. The offertory will be Attende Domine, probably sung in English, which is a good option because it is simple.</description></item><item><title>Second Week of Lent</title><link>https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jee210001/music/lenta-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jee210001/music/lenta-2/</guid><description>Aid Score
I really love these hymns for this week. The gospel is the Transfiguration of the Lord, and that theme especially comes through in &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Tis Good, Lord, to Be Here&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Behold Our Lord Transfigured&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Tis Good Lord&amp;rdquo; is a good processional in a chapel with such a short space to process, and it primes the congregation for Transfiguration! &amp;ldquo;O Amor Quam Ecstaticus,&amp;rdquo; or in its English translation, &amp;ldquo;O Love, How Deep, How Broad, How High,&amp;rdquo; is a really excellent hymn written by Thomas ï¿½ Kempis in the fifteenth century.</description></item><item><title>First Week of Lent</title><link>https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jee210001/music/lenta-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 13:24:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jee210001/music/lenta-1/</guid><description>First Week of Lent Justitiae Domini - Score
