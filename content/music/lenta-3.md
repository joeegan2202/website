Happy spring break everybody! I fully expect to lead these hymns myself this week. You may notice I copied the tune SWABIA from last week's transfiguration hymn and used it along with Christoph Tietze's English Introit translation. I am hoping this makes it easy for people to follow since they will have heard the tune last week. The offertory will be Attende Domine, probably sung in English, which is a good option because it is simple. This will be repeated next week, which is something of a theme for my selections this week. The communion verse is simple and relatively accessible, and anyone who has heard us singing the communion verses this year may be able to catch on if they so desire. "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross" is our communion hymn, a favorite of mine with the tune ROCKINGHAM (Miller). This hymn will be repeated on Palm Sunday, as it is essentially better fitted to that day. It seemed like a good candidate for a repeat to sing during the week that nobody will be at Mass. Finally, I have put down "Jam Christe Sol Justitiae" in a translation by Judge Daniel Donahoe and set to the tune PUER NOBIS NASCITUR. I'm a little unimpressed with the jollity of the tune for the Third week of Lent, but it's a repeat for next week. Laetare Sunday can definitely support PUER NOBIS NASCITUR. "Jam Christe Sol Justitiae" is a fine hymn for Lent, or in general, and it is pretty ancient, so I appreciate the nods to traditional Catholic hymns, even if they are almost completely unknown.
