We will begin this week with another Christoph Tietze English Introit. This Sunday is commonly known as Laetare Sunday, where pink vestments can be substituted for purple and music that goes beyond supporting singing is allowed. The name Laetare Sunday comes from the first word of the Introit, and we will honor that by singing an English translation encouraging the Church to rejoice in her Messiah. Our offertory hymn will be Attende Domine, a classic of Lent that has a "major" tonality, because of course, "major" = "happy"! Rejoice! For communion we will just sing the hymn "The King of Love My Shepherd Is" which is a very peaceful hymn and that dovetails with the responsorial psalm for the day. Finally, we will repeat the "Jam Christe Sol Justitiae" from last week. The very bright and joyful PUER NOBIS NASCITUR should fit much better for Laetare Sunday, but my primary motivation for choosing this tune is that it should be a commonly known hymn in long meter.

#### Offertory Verse

We will attempt to sing my Justitiae Domini this week, if it sounds good enough tomorrow. Please do review your parts:
