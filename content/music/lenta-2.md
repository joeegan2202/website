#### Aid

I really love these hymns for this week. The gospel is the Transfiguration of the Lord, and that theme especially comes through in "'Tis Good, Lord, to Be Here" and "Behold Our Lord Transfigured". "'Tis Good Lord" is a good processional in a chapel with such a short space to process, and it primes the congregation for **Transfiguration**! "O Amor Quam Ecstaticus," or in its English translation, "O Love, How Deep, How Broad, How High," is a really excellent hymn written by Thomas á Kempis in the fifteenth century. The music is derived from a folk melody from the same time period in Britain, supposedly retelling the Battle of Agincourt. It is very interesting to compare the simplified rhythm and melody of the popular hymn tune to the original melody. While I think the hymn is fitting for any season, the selection of verses given here is cut down from the much longer original to the verses more pertinent to Lent. Because the original tells much more of the life of Christ, I wanted to cut it down to the essentially Lenten verses for the short span of an offertory. "Behold Our Lord Transfigured" is a wonderful modern hymn written by Fr. Christopher G. Phillips that artfully connects the themes of transfiguration to transubstantiation, offering a meditation on the Most Holy Sacrament. To close, we sing "Lord, Who Throughout These Forty Days" ST. FLAVIAN, because it is a classic.

I will decide tomorrow who is singing this. The verses are kind of high.
